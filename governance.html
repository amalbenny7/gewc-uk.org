          <h2>Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere</h2>
          <h4>Founder & Visionary Leader (1944–2014)</h4>
          <p>
            Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere was a towering figure in the history of Pentecostal Christianity in Nigeria and beyond. 
            A man of rare spiritual depth, fiery conviction, and remarkable humility, he devoted his life to preaching the uncompromised Word of God 
            and establishing indigenous evangelism across Africa and other parts of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1969, he founded Greater Evangelism World Crusade (GEWC), a ministry birthed out of prayer, sacrifice, and passion for soul-winning. 
            Under his leadership, GEWC became a global movement pioneering evangelism and empowering indigenous believers to spread the Gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known for his fiery preaching and humility, Apostle Numbere emphasized repentance, holiness, and the power of the Holy Spirit. 
            His life remains a testimony of obedience to God’s call, his impact enduring through the ministries and lives he transformed.
