          <h2>Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere</h2>
          <h4>Founder & Visionary Leader (1944–2014)</h4>
          <p>Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere (1944–2014) was a towering figure in the history of Pentecostal Christianity in Nigeria and beyond. A man of rare spiritual depth, fiery conviction, and remarkable humility, he devoted his life to preaching the uncompromised Word of God and establishing indigenous evangelism across Africa and other parts of the world. Through his ministry, Greater Evangelism World Crusade (GEWC), he ignited a movement that transformed countless lives and left an indelible mark on the body of Christ.</p>
          <p>Born in 1944 in Nigeria, Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere experienced a divine encounter that set him on a lifelong mission to win souls for Christ. His early years were marked by a fervent passion for the Gospel and a deep sense of calling to reach the unreached. At a time when Christianity, especially Pentecostalism, faced opposition in certain regions of Nigeria, he responded to the call of God with courage and total surrender.</p>
          <p>In 1969, Apostle Numbere founded Greater Evangelism World Crusade (GEWC), a ministry birthed out of prayer, sacrifice, and a burning passion for soul-winning. What began as a small outreach in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, grew into a global movement with branches across Nigeria, Africa, the United States, and the Far East. Under his leadership, GEWC became one of the foremost indigenous Pentecostal ministries in Nigeria, pioneering evangelism in areas that were largely unreached by the Gospel at the time. His missionary approach emphasized local leadership, cultural understanding, and the empowerment of indigenous believers to spread the Gospel within their communities.</p>
          <p>Apostle Numbere was known for his fiery preaching style and unwavering commitment to truth. He preached the “pure Word of God,” emphasizing repentance, righteousness, holiness, and the power of the Holy Spirit. Beyond his pulpit ministry, Apostle Numbere was admired for his humility, simplicity, and integrity. He lived a life of self-discipline and total dependence on God, faithfully supported by his wife, Pastor Dr. Nonyem Numbere.</p>
          <p>Even after his passing in 2014, Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere’s legacy continues through the Apostle Geoffrey D. Numbere Foundation and Bible College, which equip ministers and leaders to carry forward his vision of holiness and evangelism. GEWC remains a vibrant ministry, holding firm to the values and mission established by its founder — to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth.</p>
