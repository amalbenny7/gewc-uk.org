      <!-- History -->
      <article class="about-card" id="history">
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          The Greater Evangelism World Crusade UK began as a small fellowship with a deep conviction to reach the nations with the love and power of Jesus Christ. 
          From its early days, the church has grown steadily through faith, prayer, and commitment to community impact. 
          Our ministry was birthed out of the global movement established by God’s servant, and over the years, we have expanded across the United Kingdom, 
          connecting believers from diverse cultures and backgrounds under one vision — to know Jesus and to make Jesus known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we stand as a vibrant family of believers who continue to uphold the values of truth, holiness, service, and compassion. 
          Each gathering, outreach, and ministry arm represents a living testimony of how obedience to God’s Word transforms lives and societies. 
          Our history is not just a timeline of growth, but a reflection of God’s faithfulness throughout generations.

      <article class="about-card" id="mission">
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to know Jesus intimately and to make Him known throughout the nations. 
          We pursue this through evangelism, discipleship, and holistic community transformation. 
          Every message preached, every outreach conducted, and every act of service rendered is driven by the desire to bring the gospel to the unreached.

      <!-- Mandate -->
      <article class="about-card" id="mandate">
        <h2>Mandate</h2>
        <p>
          The church’s divine mandate is rooted in the Great Commission — to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to guide believers in living according to the Word of God. 
          We seek to build disciples who live by example, demonstrating God’s love and truth in their personal lives, families, and workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through teaching, mentoring, and community engagement, we aim to develop believers who not only profess Christ but embody His character in everyday living. 
          Our mandate reminds us that ministry extends beyond the pulpit — it is a lifestyle of service, compassion, and obedience to God’s call.
