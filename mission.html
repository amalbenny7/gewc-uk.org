    <h2>The Ministry of GEWC</h2>
    <p>The Ministry of Greater Evangelism World Crusade [GEWC] is a Pentecostal mission with its Headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State of Nigeria. Amidst much persecution, opposition and difficulties, the Ministry pioneered indigenous Pentecostal Evangelism in Rivers and Bayelsa States of Nigeria in the early 1970s.</p>

    <p>The Founder and Pioneer International Director, Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere (1944-2014) was born again on Sunday, 11 May 1969 at the University of Ife, Ibadan Campus (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife) where he was then a student of Geology. On 3 March 1970, he received the call of God for full-time service through a Vision in which the Lord Jesus Christ took him up to three heavens, and showed him crowds of perishing souls.</p>

    <p>The Lord commissioned him to go and lift up the faces of those people to look up to Him and be saved. Greater Evangelism World Crusade was founded on Saturday, 9 September 1972 during an all-night prayer meeting in Port Harcourt, the Capital City of Rivers State, Nigeria. The name, the logo, and the motto (“To know Jesus and to Make Jesus known”) were all given by the Lord through vision.</p>

    <h2>Phases of Mission</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the Vision given her by God, Greater Evangelism World Crusade has three phases in her mission — Nigeria, Africa and the rest of the world. For many years, the thrust of Greater Evangelism World Crusade has been the virtually inaccessible Eastern Delta Region of Nigeria, reaching the unreached for Jesus Christ by taking the Gospel to the downtrodden, underprivileged and forgotten people of the numerous islands and villages of Rivers and Bayelsa States.</p>

    <p>By God’s grace, the Ministry has spread to various parts of Nigeria, Africa, and Europe. Greater Evangelism World Crusade has affected many lives, leading thousands and thousands of people to salvation through Christ Jesus. Apostle Geoffrey Dabibi Numbere went to be with the Lord on 15 October, 2014 and before his demise personally named Pastor Isaac Valentine Olori to succeed him. Pastor Olori was consecrated as the International Director of the Ministry of Greater Evangelism World Crusade on Sunday, 14 December 2014.</p>
